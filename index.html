      	<h2><strong>Quotes</strong></h2>
      	<p><strong>"</strong> I had the honor to work with Derek at the NASA NCAS robot competition. Derek has seemingly endless amounts of energy and enthusiasm that he puts into all aspects of a project. He has excellent verbal communication skills, is extremely organized and is able to effectively multitask to ensure the project is completed on time. He has openness and understanding that makes him flexible when changes occur, objectively discussing new options. Finally, besides completing his primary job, he is a great team player; he gave the resources and support others needed to complete their tasks. <strong>"</strong>

      	<p><strong>"</strong> I am very grateful for the opportunity to work with Derek in the NASA Community College Aerospace Scholar on site workshop/robotics competition. My first interactions with Derek we’re via our group emails and discussion board. I immediately felt kindred to his love of prioritizing tasks and staying focused on the goal. I knew working with him would be seamless because he tuned right into what we needed to get accomplished to be the very best. He was always willing to put in the time and effort to help our team succeed. Beyond being incredibly talented and smart, he was so very relatable. He worked just as hard to stay sincere with his peers, and offer heartfelt encouragement. The entire time he was opened to and encouraged feedback and was dedicated to growing from it. He will no doubt be an incredible asset to any team. <strong>"</strong>

      	<p><strong>"</strong> Derek Fermaint was a student in my Introduction to Logic class, PHI103. He consistently did A+ work, receiving near perfect scores for all of his written work. In addition, Derek submitted an Honors paper that was outstanding and far beyond what was required. He wrote and gave an oral presentation of an in-depth analysis of John F. Kennedy’s “Race to the Moon” speech and it was one of the most thorough and interesting honors project that I have had the pleasure to read. 
      	<br>Derek is singularly committed to academic scholarship and has a boundless curiosity. As a member of my logic class, he was always prepared and engaged. His contributions to in-class discussions were particularly thoughtful and intelligent. I do not think this was just because of his interest in logic, but I am sure that Derek puts that extra effort into all of his interests. That is the type of young man he is.
      	<br>On a more personal note, on the occasions when Derek visited me during my office hours, he was congenial, interesting, and composed. He certainly has a maturity level beyond his years and the necessary intelligence and commitment to succeed at whatever he undertakes. So, I am happy to give my highest recommendation for Derek, as I am sure he will excel in all his future endeavors! <strong>"</strong>

      	<p><strong>"</strong> Derek took on great responsibility as the mechanical systems admin, and made great improvements to the surveying process by creating and implementing various efficiency methods. He was great at managing technicians and his exemplary work ethic really made a difference for the company.<strong>"</strong>
